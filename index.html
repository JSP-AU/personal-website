     <h1>Welcome<br>to my personal<br>website!</h1>
     <p>
      This website was built myself using a combination HTML and CSS.
      The purpose of this website is to act as a visual representation of the web development skills I have developed,
      in addition to being a digital resume, marketing portfolio, and personal blog. 
     <p>
      Some parts of this website are still under development or will see updates as I continue to improve my web development skills, such as adding support for mobile view.
      I hope while you're here you can learn a bit about me, if you would like to get in touch you can reach me by email or by adding me on LinkedIn!
